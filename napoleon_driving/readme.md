This page contains animations that support the master's project thesis by Melvin de Wildt. The Figure numbers refer to the Figure number in the thesis.

## Fig 14 - Avoiding obstacles

## Fig 15 - Narrowing tube width
The tube width is immediately narrowed if the obstacle has a high velocity. If the obstacle has a near 0 velocity, the tube is narrowed when the vehicle is close.
